1. The program is not consistent. It starts the good morning thread first, but the number of times that "good morning" will print before the good afternoon thread starts is variable, and so is the number of times that "good afternoon" prints. The good morning thread could end before the afternoon thread is finished, or they could finish one after the other.
//DONT FORGET MEM DIAGRAM
2. The output changes so that good morning does not execute much faster than good afternoon. Instead of good morning always executing and finishing first, they appear to run more simultaneously, and it is variable which one executes or finishes first.
3. The main method does not wait for the threads to finish before it continues. The code inside each thread is still running, so that's why there are still print statements after main has exited.
4. The join statement puts main on hold until the good morning thread has run for 5 seconds. After that, the good afternoon thread is called and main exits. The output shows that goodmorning starts printing five seconds before afternoon does, then main exits and good afternoon executes and the two threads print simultaneously but the good morning thread always finishes first.
5. join() makes main wait for the good morning thread to finish in its entirety before continuing on to call the afternoon thread and exiting. on the other hand, join(10) is a very small increment of time, enough so that at this point, main exits and calls good afternoon before good morning can execute.
