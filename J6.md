1. The program is not consistent. It starts the good morning thread first, but the number of times that "good morning" will print before the good afternoon thread starts is variable, and so is the number of times that "good afternoon" prints. The good morning thread could end before the afternoon thread is finished, or they could finish one after the other.
//DONT FORGET MEM DIAGRAM
2. The output changes so that good morning does not execute much faster than good afternoon. Instead of good morning always executing and finishing first, they appear to run more simultaneously, and it is variable which one executes or finishes first.
3. The main method does not wait for the threads to finish before it continues. The code inside each thread is still running, so that's why there are still print statements after main has exited.
4. The join statement puts main on hold until the good morning thread has run for 5 seconds. After that, the good afternoon thread is called and main exits. The output shows that goodmorning starts printing five seconds before afternoon does, then main exits and good afternoon executes and the two threads print simultaneously but the good morning thread always finishes first.
5. join() makes main wait for the good morning thread to finish in its entirety before continuing on to call the afternoon thread and exiting. on the other hand, join(10) is a very small increment of time, enough so that at this point, main exits and calls good afternoon before good morning can execute.
6. isAlive() executes a statement if a thread is still running. join() will pause one thread if another is still running, until the running thread exits.
7. the threads finish in this order: cheetah, hare, tortoise, because the sleep param is smaller the higher the speed of the animal.

```
public class AnimalFootRace {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread tortoiseThread = new AnimalRacerThread("Tortoise", 5);
        Thread hareThread = new AnimalRacerThread("Hare", 20);
        Thread cheetahThread = new AnimalRacerThread("Cheetah", 50);

        hareThread.start();
        System.out.println("On your marks, get set, go!");
        try {
            System.out.println("Giving hare a headstart for .25 seconds...");
            hareThread.join(250);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Interrupted while joining a thread...");
        }
        tortoiseThread.start();
        cheetahThread.start();
    }
}
```
This works because the join() method forces all processes to wait until hareThread has run for .25 seconds, effectively giving the hare a head start without modifying any of the speeds.

```
public class AnimalFootRace {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread tortoiseThread = new AnimalRacerThread("Tortoise", 5);
        Thread hareThread = new AnimalRacerThread("Hare", 20);
        Thread cheetahThread = new AnimalRacerThread("Cheetah", 50);
        Thread batThread = new AnimalRacerThread("Bat", 66);

        hareThread.start();
        System.out.println("On your marks, get set, go!");
        try {
            System.out.println("Giving hare a headstart for .25 seconds...");
            hareThread.join(250);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Interrupted while joining a thread...");
        }
        tortoiseThread.start();
        cheetahThread.start();
        batThread.start();
    }
}
```
Bat with the highest speed finishes before all the other threads. 
10. Yes, it could be possible, and it would result in a race condition bug.
11. The syncronized keyword ensures that getInstance is never called at the same time by two threads, by forcing one thread to wait until the other finishes calling it. 
12. SimpleThreadTwo gets stuck in the while loop because when wait(!statusFlag) is called, statusFlag is only checked once at the beginning and so the value doesn't change and the while loop never meets its exit condition.  
13. Yes, it halts. Adding the 'volatile' keyword tells the compiler than the value of statusFlag will change, so it's going to keep checking it.
14. I would add the synchronized keyword to the makeBid() method to ensure that it can't be called simultaneously by two threads, avoiding a race condition bug.
